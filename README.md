# Udacity_DAND_Final_Project_Bike_sharing_Lyft

I have chosen the bike sharing dataset found at https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data. And worked through all the 2019 data files.

Work has been divided into 2 notebooks: one for wrangling and another for visualization and presentation.

Bay Area Bike Share (now Ford GoBike) provides on-demand bike rentals for customers in San Francisco, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose. Users can unlock bikes from various stations throughout each city, and return them to any station within the same city. Clients pay for the service either through a yearly subscription or by purchasing a 24-hour or 3-day pass. Under service conditions, they can make an unlimited number of trips: trips under thirty minutes in length have no additional charge, longer trips will incur overtime fees.

Questions:
Introduction
In this analysis we will explore all the rides from 2019.
How many rides?
How many bike stations the service provides?
What are the busiest ones (so they need to keep a close eye to refill them)? What are the quietest ones? (are there people really using it?)
Who used the bikes most during the week? Subscribers or Customers? What about the weekends?
What are the peak times during the week? And weekend?
Does the volume of rides are similar during the year? Who rides most?
